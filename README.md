# File Signature Analysis

ðŸ”® A project I've worked on a final seminar project as a member of Team F4 in the Hacking Club I.Sly() in 2023.

It compares file extensions with file signatures to determine whether the file signature has been tampered with. 
By analyzing discrepancies between the declared file type (extension) and the actual binary data (file signature), the program helps identify potential file modifications or malicious alterations. 
It is designed to enhance security and file integrity verification processes.
